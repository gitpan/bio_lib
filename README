# Title     : B (for Bio) or bio_lib.pl
# Usage     : require "B.pl"; ##<-- This is very slow, so you'd better
#             copy the subroutines in your prog. or make a smaller lib files
#               which are classified according to functions(like, Bio_Seq.pl
#               for sequence handling, Bio_Array.pl for various array
#               subroutines..), or make your own module out of this, do whatever
#               you want....
#
# Function  : This is a comprehensive perl subroutine library developed
#               under Bioperl project and others.
#             URL: http://cyrah.med.harvard.edu/Bioperlsub/
#
#             This serves as the depository database for various perl subroutines
#              or algorithms developed in Bioinformatics and Genome projects.
#
#             You can copy any of the sub routines in this file, modify, use
#             in yours...
#             PLEASE MODIFY AS FREELY AS YOU WANT !! All has the same PERL copyright
#
#             All the subroutines are tested in small files
#             If you want to have such single example program
#             to see how they really work, pls contact me( A Biomatic )
#             For example, a file called  'handle_arguments.pl' exists to
#             test the subroutine 'handle_arguments'. Usually you can find them
#             in  http://cyrah.med.harvard.edu/B.pl.html
#
# Example   : require "B.pl"; BUT, I recommand you take subroutines out and
#             use it directly or modify in your programs.
# Warning   : CopyLEFTed, for the enhancement of Biology, Biomatics, and Science.
#             This is a development companion, nothing else.
#             Class is for classification of my subroutines. If it is B, it can
#             be useful for biological sequence data handling. If it's Utility,
#             it can also be used for general purpose file handling stuff.
#             File, Array, Hash,... are my classification items.
# Keywords  : Biology, perl library, sequence handling lib
# Options   : nothing (used as subroutine library)

# Author    : J. Park, Jason Johnson, Sarah Teichmann, Alex Bateman,
#               Astrid Reinhardt, and anybody contributed.
